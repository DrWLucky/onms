### ONMS - Open Neutron Multiplicity Simulation

This software allows to carry out simulations of neutron multiplicity measurements. It is based on Geant4 (version 10.2). To compile, a Geant4 installation and CMake, as well as the Boost C++ libraries is required.

Further information will be added soon.

ONMS includes several files that are part of the Fission Library, from the Physics Simulation Package (http://nuclear.llnl.gov/simulation/main.html)
